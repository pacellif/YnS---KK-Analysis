# Y(2S)+Phi Spectrum Analysis
In this framework I am presenting the script I wrote for an analysis about the searching of possible resonances 
in the spectrum of the Y(2S) → µµ + Phi → KK. 

The scripts for the analysis are `Y2SKK.py` and `CandAnalysis.py`, which open respectively the UpsTree and the CandTree.

Other `.py` files are modules where some definitions of functions are stored.
`Y2SPhiRun2List.txt` contains the path and the file names of the entire dataset.
