# YnS---KK-Analysis
The scripts for the analysis are `Y2SKK.py` and `CandAnalysis.py`, which open respectively the UpsTree and the CandTree.

Other `.py` files are modules where some definitions of functions are stored.
`Y2SPhiRun2List.txt` contains the path and the file names of the entire dataset.
